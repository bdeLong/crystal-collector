Crystal Collector

I have created a crystal collector game in the theme of the TV show Rick & Morty.

See a best of video to get the gist here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9r2aje7Xw8

Here's how the app works:

There are four crystals displayed as clickable items on the page.

The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of crystals to the player's "harvested" total score.

The game hides this amount until the player clicks on a crystal.
When the player does click one, the player's harvest counter updates.
The player wins if their total crystals harvested matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

The player loses if the crystals harvested goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player will see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. The user's harvested number will also reset to zero.
